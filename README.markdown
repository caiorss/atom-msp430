# atom-msp430

Convenience functions for using [Atom][] with the MSP430 microcontroller family.
`atom-msp430` wraps common interactions with the 430 in Atom's type-safe and beautiful Haskell DSL.
There is a Wiring-like setup/loop structure by default, or you can forgo the convenience functions to
compile whatever code structure fits your needs.

For a quick introduction in the form of a sample program, have a read of [ledblink.lhs][].
More examples will come soon!
